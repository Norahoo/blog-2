//Explore ImageNet, ImageNet sample images, Kaggle ImageNet Mini 1000. What surprises you about this data set? What questions do you have? 
I feel surprised that this data set includes so many objects, and it can even distinguish different kinds of beetles, leopards, and snow leopards. 
Sometimes even humans don't know the difference. Where do they get the data and training photos?

//Thinking back to last weekâ€™s assignment, can you think of any ethical considerations around how this data was collected Are there privacy considerations with the data?
Yes, they might use private photos without permissions. I know that some photography agencies would sell the photos or images, but I am not sure where they get all the photos. 
Nobody would know.
